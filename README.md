## General Information
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- dataset : the dataset provided by upgrad day.csv



## Conclusions
- temp, yr, weathersit_3 and windspeed are the top four varibles impacting the demand for bikes

When temp increases by 1 unit demand for bikes increases by 0.5661 numbers
When yr increases by 1 unit demand for bikes increases by 0.2339 numbers
When weathersit_3 increases by 1 unit demand for bikes decreases by 0.2491 numbers
When temp increases by 1 unit demand for bikes decreases by 0.1520 numbers
